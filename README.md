This is a Unreal Engine 5 project.

The original game tutorial is here: https://www.kodeco.com/454-how-to-create-a-simple-game-in-unreal-engine-4

I did several modifications.

1: I added health pack that the player can pick up to get more health value.

2: Enemies, if the player hits the enemy, player's health value will decrease.

3: Projectile. When players right click the mouse, bullets will be ejected. If bullets hit an enemy, players will get more score.

4: I also added some sound effect for the game in an hope to make the game more interesting.

Enjoy the game!
